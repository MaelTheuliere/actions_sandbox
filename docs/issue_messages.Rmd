## So what's actually going on in the yaml file?

You can find the `yaml` code for issue messages here:
https://github.com/ropenscilabs/CIsandbox/blob/master/.github/workflows/issuesmessage.yaml

        name: Triage

          issues:
            types: [opened]
        jobs:
          commentOnNewIssues:
            name: Comment On New Issues
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              - uses: actions/checkout@master
              - name: Comment On New Issues
                uses: actions/github@v1.0.0
                env:
                  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                with:
                  args: comment "Thanks for your issue! we are going to work on that"

  </p>
</details>

The parts of the yaml file that were tricky to understand:

`on` can be `issues`, `pull`, `pull_request` you can use one or many as `[pull, pull_request]`

`uses`: `actions/checkout@master` or for the first `actions/first-interaction@v1`
