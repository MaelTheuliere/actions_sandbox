What are GitHub actions?

GitHub actions are a cool way to trigger actions for you, that would automate some part of your process.
For example, an action can be a message every time a new issue comes up:

Actions follow the steps on a `yaml` file 

You can find the yaml code for issue messages here:

Note: this and other examples are on the Github actions repo:
